# My Portfolio Redux
A second attempt at a personal portfolio page

## Introduction

This is a personal project of mine, undertaken with an eye towards potential employers. I redesigned [an earlier portfolio website](https://github.com/CommieDog/my-portfolio) of mine from the ground up to incorporate Bootstrap and many of its design elements, such as cards and columns.

A sample deployment of the website is available on [GitHub Pages](https://commiedog.github.io/my-portfolio-redux/).

## Future Work

The biggest improvement for this website would be to have move projects for me to display, particularly on the back end. The biography section could also use a rewrite; I'm not terribly good talking about myself.
